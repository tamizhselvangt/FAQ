        <summary>What is an FAQ page?</summary>
        <p>
          An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page is a key part of a knowledge
          base because it addresses the most common questions customers have and
          is useful to customers at all stages of the customer journey. FAQs
          start with a question and then answer it concisely. Within a knowledge
          base template, FAQs can function as their own articles (e.g., "How do
          I set up a password?") or be incorporated into a longer series (e.g.,
          "How to get started with your account"). Outside of the help center, a
          chatbot can also provide support through FAQs.

        <summary>What is the purpose of an FAQ page?</summary>
        <p>
          The purpose of an FAQ page is to provide quick answers to common
          questions that your business can anticipate. An FAQ page empowers
          customers to self-serve, enabling them to find solutions quickly on
          their own. FAQ pages aren't meant to solve every issue, which is why
          it's important to include an option for customers to contact a live
          agent.

        <summary>Track your progress</summary>
        <p>
          Don’t stop thinking about your FAQ page once you have a handful of
          questions and answers posted. Instead, look for ways to constantly add
          to your answer bank, and continue to shift the questions you post
          based on customer needs. If you choose to use the one-question survey
          at the end of your responses, review how many people mark them as
          helpful or unhelpful. For questions where the majority of customers
          said the answer didn’t help, see how you can expand on that answer
          with more resources. Or consider adding new questions to your FAQ page
          to fill in the gaps.

        <summary>Make your FAQ page easy to find</summary>
        <p>
          For customers to use your FAQ page, it needs to be easily
          accessible—both on and off your site. Start by optimizing the content
          for search with SEO tactics. That way, if customers turn to Google for
          an answer about your product instead of visiting your website, the
          search engine can still route them to the right FAQ page. For
          customers who are going straight to your site for answers, put the
          link to your FAQ or support page in a highly visible place—preferably
          in the top navigation bar. This will encourage customers to read
          through the FAQs before they reach out to a support rep or open a
          ticket.

            Structure your content in a way that Google can easily crawl. For
            example, the topic cluster model helps organize your content by a
            main topic and subtopics.
